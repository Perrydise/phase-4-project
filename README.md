# Phase-4-Project

# Weclome to Mountain View

The mission of this website is to allow skiers and snowboarders of all levels to come into the same space and share their thoughts of mountains from all over the world!  Have you ever wanted to schedule a ski trip to Colorado but didn't know where to go because of all the different resorts?  Mountain View is here to help! With the ability to add new mountains and create reviews on every one, Mountain View is the hub for helping you find the right mountain!

# All there is

The way our website stands out above all others is the way it is community driven.  With no sponsors we allow the rider/skier to come in and leave an honest review on what they liked and/or disliked about the moutain!  We want the USER to be able to be free in reviews and allow the user to create reviews on the smallest of mountains.  If it exists, add it!

# The Login Page

A login page is what grabs the users attention and tells them everything they need to know about what they will be getting themselves into when they explore the rest of the page.  With a welcomeing title and a list of what users can expect upon entering the site, the home page is a very welcoming place to land on.

# The Mountain Display page

The design of this page is super basic to allow for ease of access to the user.  With a standard list of mountains with their name and location, a user can view the list to see if there mountain to review is there and if so click the button "Leave a Review!" to do just that.

# The Single Mountain Display page

Once a user has clicked on the reviews button it takes them to a page devised to the mountain that's been clicked on with all of its reviews.  Here a user can delete a review they left while reading the others!

# Leave a Review Page

This page is where the magic happens! Once a user wants to leave a review on a mountain they will navigate to this page.  On here will be a simple review box to allow the user to type in what they have to say and then select a mountain to which the review belongs to!  If the user doesn't see the mountain they wish to review they click the "Didnt see your mountain" button and simply add it through the form and boom! A mountain with a review has been established!
